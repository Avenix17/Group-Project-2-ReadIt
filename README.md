# Group-Project-2-ReadIt

## Description

Our group developed an app dedicated to book lovers to connect with one another and search for books that they want to read. In further future development, the user will be able to add searched books to lists and keep personal notes.

### Note

The Profile and Setting pages of ReadIt have not yet been completed and are part of future development.

### User Story

As a book enthusiast,
I want a website that allows me to keep track of books, notes, and connect with others,
so that I can be more involved and organized with my reading.
